    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This is a creamy Chinese rice porridge also known as congee. It cooks perfectly in a slow cooker too. Serve garnished with additional scallions and soy sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3 bone-in chicken thighs</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>&frac12; cup chopped scallions</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced</li>
        <li>6 cups water</li>
        <li>1 cup short-grain brown rice</li>
        <li>2 cups thinly sliced cabbage</li>
        <li>1 cup snow peas</li>
        <li>1 cup bean sprouts</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>&frac12; cup chopped cilantro leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Place chicken in hot oil, season with salt and ground black pepper and cook until well-browned, about 5 minutes per side. Remove chicken and set aside. Add scallions, ginger, garlic, and jalapeno pepper to the pot; cook until soft, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour water and rice into pot; bring to a boil, then lower heat to simmer. Cover the pot partially and cook for about 1 hour, stirring occasionally to prevent rice from sticking to the bottom.</li>
        <li>Stir chicken into soup and cover partially. Continue to cook until the soup is creamy with a porridge-like consistency, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken, pull meat from bones, and return meat to the pot. Stir in cabbage, snow peas, bean sprouts, soy sauce, and sesame oil; cook until vegetables are just tender, about 5 minutes. Garnish jook with cilantro.</li>
    </ol>
